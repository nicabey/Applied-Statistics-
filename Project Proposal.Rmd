I have found the data for this project at https://www.kaggle.com/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m I then downloaded the dataset and saved it as a .CSV file and uploaded it into my Github repository (Applied-Statistics). With this data I hope to show any relationship between user ratings and genre or other things if the idea comes to me, but for now its just the former. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicabey/Applied-Statistics-/main/goodreads-data.csv')
```

## 
Here is a small portion of the data and the summary statistics 
```{r}
head(data)
summary(data)
```
